## About Me 💗🎀🦋

Hello! I'm Mashal, a passionate and creative student currently completing a Full Stack Engineering BootCamp, in the hopes of breaking into tech as a Front End Engineer 😊

🌟I love cats, pink things, exploring new places, reading about history and learning new things (and eating cake)!

💻Within the boot camp, I have learnt skills in various programming languages, frameworks and tools essential for both front-end and back-end development. 

🩺I have an interest in health tech as I believe that healthcare can be significantly improved through the integration of advanced technology. 

🔜Soon, after learning other coding languages such as Python, natural language processing & AI, I would love to create an application about Speech and Language Therapy.

😍I am excited about contributing to projects that require creativity, technical expertise and a problem-solving mindset.

💕I would greatly appreciate and am open to any information, support, advice and opportunities!
